# IBM Capstone Project #

**Introduction/Business Problem**
My project will use the python skills which I have learnt so far to help decide where to build a new police station in London. 


**Data**
The data used will be:
  Crime data from Met Police across London since 1999.
  Foursquare API database call for location data on current police station locations in London.

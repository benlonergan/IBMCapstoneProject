# IBM Capstone Project #

**Introduction/Business Problem**
My project will use the python skills which I have learnt so far to help decide where to build a new police station in London. I have choosen to address this problem because I have a genuine interest in what the data may reveal. Areas with a high crime rates may benefit from police station of close proximity to improve response time to crimes. This analysis may be of use to the govt/police to assist them in a decision to construct a new police station based on crime hotspots. 


**Data**
The data used will be:
  Crime data from Met Police across London since 1999.
  Foursquare API database call for location data on current police station locations in London.
